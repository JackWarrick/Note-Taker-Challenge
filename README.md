## Description

This application is for writing and saving notes. The note taker should have a landing page with a link to a notes page. The link should direct the user to the existing notes with empty areas for taking more notes. The note taker should allow new notes to be created and the save icon should appear when a note title and text are entered. The note taker should allow the user to click the save icon to save a new note on the left side with the others. The note taker should allow the user to click on an existing note so that note appears in the right side. The note taker should allow the user to click on the write icon to enter a new note.

## Installation

The user should run the server and then go to the location.
